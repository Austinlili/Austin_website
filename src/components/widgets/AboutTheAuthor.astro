      Hi! I'm Li-Hsuan â€” a biomedical science nerd turned electrical engineering explorer. ðŸ§ªâš¡ Iâ€™ve spent years fine-tuning hydrogel electrodes and diving deep into how biology and technology can work hand in hand.

      Soon, Iâ€™ll be heading to the University of Florida for my Masterâ€™s in Electrical & Computer Engineering! Always excited to connect, brainstorm, and collaborate on anything at the intersection of science, tech, and a little bit of crazy curiosity.
