This post summarizes a recent study published in *International Journal of Molecular Sciences (IJMS, 2024)*. The research investigates the role of **CD44-ICD** in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced hepatic inflammation and the therapeutic potential of its inhibition using **DAPT**.

## Why Study CD44-ICD?

CD44 is a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in inflammatory responses. Its **intracellular domain (ICD)** regulates several signaling pathways, including NF-κB. However, the role of CD44-ICD in **sepsis-induced liver inflammation** remained unexplored—until now.

## Key Findings

- **Inhibiting CD44-ICD using DAPT** significantly reduced liver enzymes (AST, ALT), tissue necrosis, and immune cell infiltration in mice exposed to LPS.
- Pro-inflammatory mediators including **IL-1β**, **iNOS**, and **NO** were significantly downregulated in both mouse livers and **Chang cells**.
- Western blot and immunohistochemistry confirmed that **NF-κB pathway activation** was suppressed after CD44-ICD inhibition.
- CD44 and CD44-ICD expression themselves were also reduced, suggesting **CD44-ICD acts as a key signal transducer** in LPS-induced inflammation.

## Experimental Setup

- **In vivo**: C57BL/6 mice were divided into 4 groups (Normal, DAPT, LPS, DAPT+LPS). LPS (10 mg/kg) induced inflammation; DAPT (10 mg/kg) was administered 30 mins prior.
- **In vitro**: Chang cells were treated with LPS ± DAPT (5, 10, 20 μM) to evaluate inflammatory signaling.
- **Evaluations**: AST/ALT levels, histology, Western blot (p-IKK, p-IκB, NF-κB, IL-1β, CD44), and ELISA for NO/IL-1β were conducted.

## Significance

This study identifies **CD44-ICD** as a **critical upstream regulator** of the NF-κB pathway in LPS-induced hepatic inflammation, supporting its **potential as a therapeutic target** for sepsis-induced liver injury.

## Next Steps

Further research using **CD44-ICD knockout mice** and a **CLP (cecal ligation and puncture)** sepsis model will be essential to fully validate this therapeutic avenue.
